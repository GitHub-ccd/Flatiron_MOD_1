    "# Setting up a Professional Data Science Environment - Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "If you want to become a professional data scientist, it’s important to take a little time to “set yourself up for success” by installing and learning to use the right tools on your computer. In this lesson, you will install Git and Anaconda and in the next lesson you will setup a virtual environment. If you already have Git and Anaconda installed, feel free to skip to the next lesson to get started with cloning, virtual environment setup, and testing!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Install Git\n",
    "* Install Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Tools do Professional Data Scientists Use?\n",
    "* **Python** - There are many languages that can be used for data science, but these days most data scientists are using Python to write their code.\n",
    "* **Jupyter Notebook** - Most of those data scientists use Jupyter Notebook for writing their Python. Jupyter Notebook is a tool that allows you to mix comments in-between your code snippets so you can document and share your thinking process and make it easier for others to review, replicate and expand on your work. It's also what we're using for almost all of our lessons in this course!\n",
    "* **Anaconda** - Anaconda is one of the most popular ways for data scientists to install Python and Jupyter Notebook on their computers. It also provides package management and virtual environments so you can get all the latest data science tools running like NumPy, SciPy, and Tensorflow, and so you can use different versions of Python and your packages for different projects without them conflicting with each other.\n",
    "* **Git** - Git is a version control system. It’s a way of keeping track of all the changes made across your project. Think of it like “track changes” in Word - but with the ability to track changes across multiple documents. At Flatiron School, we use Git to keep track of all of the lessons we create and all the changes we make to them.\n",
    "* **GitHub** - GitHub is a website where data scientists (and programmers) can save their work in case their computer breaks, and share it with their team or the world! At Flatiron School, we store all of our lessons on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s going to take us a few minutes to get this all installed, but once we do, not only will you be set-up for working through the course, but you’ll also have a professional data science setup on your computer for any future courses or projects you want to work on!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computer Prerequisites\n",
    "There are many amazing computing devices available these days, but not all of them will allow you to do data science. We love smartphones, flip phones, Chromebooks, tablets (including iPads), game boys, Nintendo switches, roku’s and arduino’s. You’re not going to be able to complete this course on any of those devices - sorry.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re going to need a computer (laptop or desktop). It should be running a recent (last 3-4 years) version of MacOS, Windows or Linux, and ideally, it should have 8Gb of RAM and at least 20Gb free hard drive space. More information [here](https://flatironschool.com/wp-content/uploads/Student-Facing-Computer-Requirements.pdf):\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you have a computer that meets the requirements, let’s start by getting git Installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Git\n",
    "For each tool, we’ll provide installation instructions for the two most common operating systems - Windows and MacOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Windows</summary>\n",
    "Go [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Then double click on the downloaded exe file. It may open a window asking if you want to allow this application to make changes to your device. Just click “yes”. It will then open the installer. Click “next” to accept the license, and when you “select components” on the next screen make sure to keep the “Windows explorer integration” options checked.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is strongly suggested that you select any options to install and use the \"Git Bash\" shell, it's generally included by default. In short, the Git Bash shell will allow students with either Windows or Mac computers to run the same set of commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note - if there are any differences in the options provided in the installer you download, just accept the defaults - they’ll probably be fine!\n",
    "\n",
    "![screen-1](http://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/data-science/screen-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When asked to select an editor, if you’re familiar with vi/vim feel free to use that, otherwise you should probably select an easier to use text editor such as nano.\n",
    "\n",
    "![screen-2](http://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/data-science/screen-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When asked to adjust your PATH environment, either of the first two options is fine as you’ll mainly be using Git from the new “Git Bash” program that is being installed. You’re probably best to select “use Git from the Windows Command Prompt” as it’ll give you the option of using it there in the future if you wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "![screen-0](http://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/data-science/screen-0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For https, you should select the “use the OpenSSL library” option.\n",

    "![screen-4](http://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/data-science/screen-4.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "For extra options, enable the file system caching and the git credential manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "![screen-6](http://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/data-science/screen-6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "And then wait while Git is installed onto your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "![screen-7](http://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/data-science/screen-7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, click finish to complete setup\n",

    "<summary>Mac</summary>\n",
    "If you are comfortable with the command line and have installed [homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you should install Git by running the command `brew install git` in a terminal window.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have no idea what the last paragraph meant, just go [here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac). Then double click on the downloaded dmg file and it will open a small finder window looking something like this (the exact name and version will change over time):\n",

Then select “Security and Privacy”, select the “General” tag, click on the lock to make changes at the bottom of the window (you’ll have to enter your password). Below the “Allow apps downloaded from” option, you should see a message stating that an app was blocked from opening. (If you don’t see this message, double click on the .pkg file again and then look back at the Security & Privacy screen and it should pop up).  Click the “open anyway” button.\n",

    "\n",
    "To confirm you have installed Git successfully, open a terminal window (in Windows, using the start menu, open the “Git Bash” program to get a terminal, on a mac, just open the “Terminal” app in the “Utilities” folder within your “Applications” folder). Type `git --version`. It should return the version of git you are running.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you’re in the terminal, you should also set up your name and email address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type `git config --global user.name`\n",
