    "# SQL Interview Questions  - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "* INTEGER: These are signed interger values. Up to 8 bytes can be used to store the interger value, depending on how large it is. \n",
    "* REAL: The SQLite equivalent of a Float value like we would see in python, REAL calues are used to store decimal numbers.\n",
    "* TEXT: The SQLite equivalent of a string. Typically uses encodings such as UTF-8.\n",
    "* BLOB: Exactly as it sounds, a 'blob' of data that is stored exactly as it was input. For instance, if we stored an image in SQLite database, it would be stored as a BLOB, and would not be touched or changed in any way. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Primary keys are the unique keys assigned to every record in a table. A Forigh key is a column in a tale that points to the primary key of an record in a different table that an item has a relationship with. JOIN statements work by matching up rows where the forign key in one table matches the primary key for a row (or rows) in a different table. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "SQL databeses can have one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many kind of relationships. \n",
    "* one-to-one: each record in the table is linked o only one record in a different table.\n",
    "* one-to-many: one record in the table linked to many records in corrosponding table. For example a class table and a student table tat we could use to store class roster. Since one class can have many students it's a one-to-many relationship that would be created by giving the \"student\" records a forign key column that would reference the primary key of the class they are enrolled in. \n",
    "* many-to-many: These are more complex relationships because it's possible many records on one table to relate to many records in the other table. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "The main JOIN types are inner, outer, Left and Right joins. Full join is also possivle but less useful. The easiest way to think about JOINs is to picture a Venn Diagram, with each circle representing a different table. The area where the circles overlap represents the rows where the Primary keys from one table match the Forign Keys from another table. \n",
    "\n",
    "* INNER JOIN returns only the overlapping portion of the Venn Diagram, where the record's key matches a key in the other table.\n",
    "* OUTER JOIN returns only the rows from each table where there is no corresponding matche with with the other table. \n",
    "* LEFT JOIN returns every record in the left table, and any rows from the right table that happens to kave a key that matches with the left table. And vise-versa for the RIGHT JOIN. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Aggregate functions are used to compute things like a COUNT or a MEAN (an aggregation of similar records). These functions perform these calculations on a 'group' that we must specify. For instance, assume we have a table containing the population for each country in the world, for each year for the last 20 years. If we wanted to get the mean of the population of a country across all 20 years, or the mean population of all countries for each given year. Both are mean values, and one is not more correct than the other, so the SQL server would throw an error because of the ambiguity. To make this work, we would need to specify whether we wanted the mean when the data is grouped by country (which would return the mean population of a country over the last 20 year span) or grouped by the year (which would return the mean population of the average country for each of the seperate years). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Associative Entities, also called JOIN tables, are type of table used to allow us to perform manny-to-many JOINs. THese tables act as a list that keep track of each of the different connections between an entitity in one table and all of that entity's connections in the other table. Whole we can JOIN tables directly for one-to-one and one-to-many relationships, we must use Associative Entity in order to pull of a JOIN between two tables with many-tomany relationship. \n",
    "\n",
